            <h1>Friend, Adventurer, Optimist.  </h1>
                <p>I believe that life's meaning arises from the people you surround yourself with. Being a people-person,
                    I enjoy working, interacting and improving myself together with other people. </p>
                <p>I love trying new things. From learning photoshop to video editing to making my own website, I enjoy pushing
                boundaries and taking on challenges in my free time.  </p>
                <p>I prefer seeing the glass half-full than half-empty. After all, sometimes, life gets a little better
                when you treat it less seriously. </p>

        <h2 class="askqn">About Me - Q&A</h2>
        <h3>1. Why pride yourself as a friend?</h3>
        <p>As a person, I value meaningful relationships with other people. I believe that no man is an island and that success and happiness are best shared with the people you achieve it with.
          Therefore, beyond pushing myself to be better, I enjoy working with others to not only enable them to be better,
          but learn from them to become a better individual myself. </p>
          <h3>2. What was the most adventurous thing you did?</h3>
          <p>Beyond my requirements in my professional Computer Science degree, I spend time pursuing my other passions in my free time.
            The most adventurous adventure I had would be learning how to make music, which I had no prior experience before.
            I started from scratch, learning how to use the software as well as its functionalities.
            The toughest part in this process was learning how to match keys between different songs, which took me a while to grasp.
            However, after 3 months, I was able to make decent mash-ups and as of today, have made slightly more than
            10 mash-ups thus far!</p>
          <h3>3. How does optimism look like for you?</h3>
          <p>To me, optimism is recognising that there is always a silver lining.
            When bad things happen, I recognise that it happened, but I choose not to dwell on it and try to see what I
            can learn from it. I choose to see that things happen for a reason and there is always something that I can
            learn from it. </p>
